# UK Node of the Digital Earths Global Hackathon

A group of experiments have been conducted using the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM) with a focus on the DYAMOND-3 period (Jan 2020-Feb 2021). While these experiments include standalone explicit convection global simulations we have also developed a cyclic tropical channel and include limited area model simulations to build our understanding of how resolving smaller-scale processes feeds back on to the large-scale atmospheric circulation.
